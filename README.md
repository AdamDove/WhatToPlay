# WhatToPlay
With a Steam login and a Steam API key, this program will allow you to compare steam libraries across any number or combination of your friends.

We use this for our Friday Night Gaming.  The built in Steam comparison only allows you to compare with a single friend at a time.

Now we know which games we all have, and which games only one of us is missing (i.e. buy it for next session :) )
